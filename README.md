# Simulation of a baseball pitch

Simulation of a baseball pitch considering gravitational, drag and magnus force using euler integration method. 

## Results
With standard values ball travels about 3m in direction perpendicular to gravitational acceleration and velocity.
This is not in agreement with https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/beginners-guide-to-aeronautics/foilsimb/. Value as in nasa's simulation could be achieved by deviding magnus force by factor of $2*\pi$. As I don't have acces to their computations, I can not make any further conclusions. However, 3m seams to be too much.
